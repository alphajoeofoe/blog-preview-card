### What I learned

I  learned how to use box-shadow in this one. i was confused at first how you get that dark shadow and i struggled a bit . so i finished the basics first and went to mdn to learn how it all works. like how thers an x-axis and y-axis and a blur effect and then color.





### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_backgrounds_and_borders/Box-shadow_generator) - This helped me for the box-shadow css. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward if needed.
- [Example resource 2](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand it. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
